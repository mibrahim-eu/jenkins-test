I tried in this project to create the following resources:

1. VPC
2. Subnet
3. IGW
4. Routing Table
5. EC2
6. Install on the EC2 docker and docker compose
7. SSH to the EC2

There was a small issue to connect to the machine through the console of AWS. It seems that this issue is related to the security groups
